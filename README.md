# CSS3 Water
**[The Demo](http://dulnan.net/water)**

A small 1k demo for a water/sea/whatever effect using the [CSS3 filter property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/filter) and animations.
Closure Compiler is used to reduce the size of the JavaScript.

## How to compile
Install all the dependencies with `npm install` and then compile using `gulp`.

## Files and folders
The *demo* folder contains the minified js/css files and *demo.html* where both js/css files are embedded.
*debug/debug.html* is useful for debugging, because both css/js files are linked, not embedded.
